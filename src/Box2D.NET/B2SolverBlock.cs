// Solver work is partitioned into fixed-size blocks that worker threads claim
// in parallel via atomic CAS on a per-block syncIndex. The descriptor (b2SolverBlock)
// and the atomic counter sit in a wrapping b2SyncBlock so the CAS-winner can
// pass the descriptor by value into stage tasks without aliasing the atomic
// memory other threads are CAS-writing. Three properties of this design
// matter for performance:
//
// 1. Distributed contention. Per-block atomic syncIndex avoids the cache line stampede
//    that a single shared fetch_add counter would cause. Once a worker
//    settles into a block range, its CAS targets live in its own L1.
//
// 2. Monotonic syncIndex across iterations. Iterative stages (warm start,
//    solve, relax) reuse the same block array every sub-step iteration.
//    syncIndex grows each iteration; workers CAS (prev, prev+1), so the
//    main thread never touches any per-block state between iterations.
//    Non-iterative stages simply use syncIndex 1.
//
// 3. L2 affinity across iterations. Each worker picks a start offset from
//    its workerIndex, then scans forward and (after wrap) backward:
//
//      blocks:   [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]
//                 ^           ^           ^   ^
//                 W0          W1          W2  W3   <- start offsets
//
//    W0 claims 0,1,2,3 (forward), W1 claims 4,5, etc. Under balanced load
//    each worker re-hits the same block range every iteration, keeping that
//    range's hot data resident in its L2. A failed CAS means a neighbour
//    already claimed the block, so the stealing worker stops -- preserving
//    locality under mild imbalance while still draining the queue.
//
// A graph color stage lays out joint blocks first, then contact blocks:
//
//      stage->blocks ->
//        +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
//        |  J0  |  J1  |  J2  |  C0  |  C1  |  C2  |  C3  |
//        +------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
//        <-- graphJointBlocks --><---- graphContactBlocks ---->
//
// Each block carries its type so the dispatcher routes J-blocks to the joint
// solver and C-blocks to the SIMD contact solver; both kinds run concurrently
// within the stage -- no barrier between them. The type tag lives on the
// block (not the stage) so that mixed-type stages can keep the concurrency.
//
